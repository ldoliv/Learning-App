- Do the higher order thinking as early as possible, so, "create", "evaluate", "analyse" and "apply"
- make an effort to feel confused, it means you are engaged and learning


Don't:
- Learn topic concept one at a time and take notes, you need to relate the info to other info and to the bigger picture



AHA Moment
-----------------------------------

For each topic try to understand that 1 main concept/knowledge, the key takeaway for that topic.
Read throught the topic and simplify it to the main idea concept that you would like to remember it by.
Create an analogy, abstract for simplification.

To Do:
-> Priming, 1st get the big picture of what you are about to learn. Quickly go through all the content you will cover, and get an ideia of the "all". Make an effort just to not focus on the details.
-> After that, do a quick mind map.

-> Take few notes, the fewer the better. The more notes you write the more offloading you are doing.
Also reading your notes goes through your brain to the motor reflex of writing what you are reading and just not thinking about what it is that you are reading.
Have an internal focus, not an external dependency.

-> How can I make this simpler to understand?
-> Explain it as if you were explaining it to a 5th grade student. (Feynam Technique)

-> How can I apply this?
-> How is this connected to what I already know?
-> How does this relate to the bigger picture?



- Memorize events, so like an action happening instead of the content.
- Glance at the text as if you were reading it but at 5x speed without reading the actual words.
	What you are doing is priming your brain and subconscious so that when you do in fact read it it will be much easier to understand.



- be confused enought, it means you are making an effort to learn something.
- 1st relate the information to existing information that you already know, also try to see the big picture
	- ask why, how, when
	- What aspects are common, and what is complete oposite?

- Things you don't understand don't spend too much time on it, take note of the page and go back to it after some amount of info is consumed to see if already makes sense.
- instead of learning in order, learn by attention and curiosity engagement
- Delayed note taking, try to delay, think about the subject first and figure out what makes sense and what doesn't, make a mind map first in your head before jotting down notes.


Revising:
	- the 1st revision within 12 hours
	- make the revising engaging by using "how", "when", "why", relate info and to the bigger picture, try to get new insights from the questions to explore for more information so you can make more connections.You won't get anything out of it by just rereading or mentally rehersing the same thing over and over again. You have to activate higher order learning.
	- make it challenging by recalling
	- try to make new diagrams, try to make the revision different every time so you don't saturate your learning possibility


Mind map:
	Mneumonic "GRIND"
	
	- Grouped - Organize ideias into various groups and boxes
		- Allows us to make more sense of the information and simplifies the knowledge.
		- Smaller concepts that are isolated from each other can fit together into a box.

	- Reflective
		- Your notes should be a reflection of whatever goes on inside your mind

	- Interconnected
		- We connect the groups of information (that we created before) with each other
		- Look for more connections that may exist, by getting information from other sources

	- Non-verbal
		- Use more creative ways of expression rather that using words or speach.
		- More free flowing and non-verbal like a mind map

	- Directional
		- Give the connections order and directionality to them.
		- Gives us flow, a cause + effect relationship

	- Emphesised
		- Visually emphesise areas that are importing with a double line or with caps.
		- Using mind maps the technique becomes easier, while the learning remains high quality
