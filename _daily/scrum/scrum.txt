Agile are a set of principles, like a best practice guidelines for software development.

Scrum is a framework that tries to implement those principles.


The product backlog is like a todolist.
	- The most important tasks being at the top.
	- The developer chooses what is managably possible to do for the next sprint. He drags and drops from the backlog to the sprint group. (Jira)


During the sprint there are group events called cerimonies, such as:

	During the sprint:

		- Daily scrum or standup
			- Short meeting, to know what everyone is doing, oportunity to voice any concerns

			- Sprint planning
				- Moving tasks from the backlog to the sprint
				who does the planning?
					Developers


	On sprint completion:

		- Sprint reviews
			- Who is it for?
				Product owner
				- Show acomplished backlog items to the product owner.
				- Product owner reworks the backlog based on the current sprint

		- Sprint retrospectives
			- Who is it for?
				- Mostly the development team.
				- Review how the sprint went, what worked well, and what didn't work, and needs to be improved next time.
